# D&D Family Tree Generator

Hello, this is a small project I made originally for myself to randomly generate family trees. There are lots of customization options if you're willing to edit the code, less so for now in its normal state as I haven't done a lot to add that functionality. If you run the exe as is, the program will proceed to go through and generate 5 families (and their trees) for each type of race. This uses Xanathar's Guide to Everything's 'This is Your Life' to base the generation off of.

The output contains FamilyScripts and just normal data. The data is just a long list of all the people involved, their stats, etc. The familyscript file exports a specific format that can be used at this website with these instructions:

https://familyecho.com/#

- On this page, at the bottom left select "Import GEDCOM or FamilyScript..."
- At the top of that panel, select "Choose File" and find and select the file generated (the FamilyScript one only. Files are generated in the same folder as the exe, under a folder called Families)
- Select "Import"
- After a moment it will ask you to select a person, this will be the person you start with highlighting. Just select "Finish Import"
- Tada you're done. It should display the families and such, you can click on other names to see how their famiies connect. Additionally at the bottom middle theres a "Show options" button and you can see different information about them from birth date (and death) to their generated Xanathar life events.
